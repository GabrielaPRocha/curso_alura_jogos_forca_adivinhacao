She
doesn't
kiss
me
on
the
mouth
anymore
'Cause
it's
more
intimate
than
she
thinks
we
should
get
She
doesn't
look
me
in
the
eyes
anymore
Too
scared
of
what
she'll
see
somebody
holdin'
me
When
I
wake
up
all
alone
And
I'm
thinking
of
your
skin
I
remember
I
remember
what
you
told
me
Said
that
we're
not
lovers
we're
just
strangers
We're
not
lovers
we're
just
strangers
With
the
same
damn
hunger
She
doesn't
call
me
on
the
phone
anymore
She's
never
listening
she
says
it's
innocent
She
doesn't
let
me
have
control
anymore
I
must've
crossed
a line
I
must've
lost
my
mind
When
I
 wake
 up
 all
alone
And
I'm
thinking
of
your
skin
I
remember
I
remember
what
 you
 told
me
Said
that
we're
not
lovers
we're
just
strangers
With
the
same
damn
hunger
We're
not lovers
we're
 just
 strangers
With
the
same
damn
hunger
I
 miss
the
mornings
with
you
laying
in
my
bed
replaying
in
my
head
I
 miss
 the
 thought
 of a forever, you and me
But all you're missing is my body, oh
Said we're
not
lovers
Cause
we're
just
strangers
With
the
same
damn
hunger
touch
hed
to be loved
to
feel
anything
at
all
We're
not
lovers
we're
just
strangers
With
the
same
damn
hunger
To
be
touched
to
be
loved
to
feel
anything
at
all
To
feel
anything
at
all
You
lost
it
